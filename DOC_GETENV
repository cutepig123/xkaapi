* Available environment variables:

KAAPI_CPUSET: 
  CPUSET for mapping kprocessors to CPU.
KAAPI_CPUCOUNT: 
  Number of CPU to used into the CPUSET.
  If CPUSET is not defined, then the OS maps 
  kprocessors to CPU.

KAAPI_GPUSET: 
  CPUSET for mapping kprocessors that manage GPU. 

KAAPI_STACKSIZE: 
  Stack size to store tasks and task' arguments.
  Unit: Byte

KAAPI_NETWORK:
  Name of the network to used.
    - taknet: implemented in KAAPI, not yet reported in XKAAPI
    - socknet: implemented in KAAPI, not yet reported in XKAAPI
    - gasnet: implemented in XKAAPI
    - mpinet: partially implemented in XKAAPI. Not operational.
    
KAAPI_NETWORK_SEGMENT:
    - Size of memory reserved for remote DMA operation.
    Pass to the gasnet initialization. 
    Users by taknet network to create a memory mapping.

KAAPI_NETWORK_BASE_ADDR:
    - Address where all processus will try to map segment.
    - Used currently only in the taknet network.

KAAPI_DISPLAY_PERF: 1, full, resume 

KAAPI_RECORD_TRACE: defined to generate trace of events at runtime.
  Only available if the library was configured with --with-perfcounter
KAAPI_RECORD_MASK: name[,name]* where name is either compute, idle, steal or the event number.
  Only record event in the mask.
  
KAAPI_PERF_PAPIES:

KAAPI_DUMP_GRAPH:
  Dump the graph after spawning task with SetStaticSched attribut
  is used. Only operational if XKaapi library is compiled with
  '--with-perfcounter=debug'.

KAAPI_DOT_NODATA_LINK:
  Do not dump data nodes in the DFG dot graph.
  
KAAPI_DOT_NOACTIVATION_LINK:
  Do not print activation link between tasks when graph is dump into 
  the dot output.

KAAPI_DOT_NOVERSION_LINK:
  Do not print link between version of data when graph is dump into the dot output.
  
KAAPI_DOT_NOLABEL:
  Do not print information inside each task node or data node of the dot output.

KAAPI_DUMP_PERIOD:
  Dump the internal state at given period (in second).
  Only work with debug library.

KAAPI_PUSH_AFFINITY: (string)
  Set the algorithm affinity at push operation, when a task is activated. 
  Options are: rand, locality, writer, local.
  Default is `local'.

KAAPI_STEAL_AFFINITY: (string)
  Set the algorithm affinity at steal operation.
  Options are: cp, locality, writer, 1.
  Default is 1 (first).

* CUDA support

KAAPI_CUDA_WINDOW_SIZE: (number)
  Set the sliding window size of GPU tasks to overlap (default is 2).

KAAPI_CUDA_PEER: (0 or 1)
  Enable peer-to-peer memory copy (default disabled).

KAAPI_CUDA_TRACE_BUFFER: (number)
  Set the buffer size for CUDA traces in MBytes (default is 1 MB).

KAAPI_CUDA_CACHE_POLICY: (string)
  Set the software cache policy for GPUs. Options are lru (least recently used) or lru_double 
  (least recently used based on data access). Default is lru_double.
