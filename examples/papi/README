-- purpose
. This example shows how to use papi performance counters
to measure performance event on a foreach algorithm.

-- building
. currently there is a problem in the build system and the
user has to give the path of the papi library when compiling
its code, if it does not reside in a system wide location.

-- running
. the KAAPI_PERF_PAPIES environment variable is used to
tell the runtime which papi counter we want to measure. 
. example for l1 cache misses, total cycles and fpu ops count:
KAAPI_PERF_PAPIES=PAPI_L1_DCM,PAPI_TOT_CYC,PAPI_FP_OPS ./a.out

-- limitation and notes
. up to 3 KAAPI_PERF_ID_PAPI_x counters
. man papi_avail(3) for a list of supported events
. when using kaapi_perf_accum_counters and equivalent routines, the buffer
 size must equal the cardinalty of the corresponding perf_idset
. there is currently no way for the user to define measurment sections
. it is not posisble to dynamically change the event set to measure
. due to some temporary limitations in the build system, build.sh and
run.sh scripts are provided as examples of how to build and run a program
using performance counters
