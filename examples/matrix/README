The repository contains several examples about linear algebra:
- matrix prodcut
- LU factorization
- Cholesky facotization

All these examples are based on C BLAS and C LAPACK (ATLAS interface),
and they cannot be compiled without definition of following environment
variables:
CBLAS_LDFLAGS: should includes libraries for cblas and clapack, for
  instance, if ATLAS was installed into /usr/local/atlas:
      > export CBLAS_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/atlas/lib -llapack -lcblas -latlas"
CBLAS_CPPFLAGS: directory of include file cblas.h and clapack.h, for
  instance, if ATLAS was installed into /usr/local/atlas:
    > export CBLAS_CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/atlas/include"

If ATLAS in into system path for finding includes or libs, then these
environment variables are useless.
