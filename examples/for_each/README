for_each_kaapi_0.c implements the for_each stl algorithm using the low level
kaapi C adaptive interface. The master can be stolen by any thief, but the
thief cannot be stolen. This is the simplest possible way to implement an
algorithm using this interface. A concurrent range is used to maintain the
range to process.

for_each_kaapi_1.c implements the same as above, except a thief can be stolen
by another thief.
