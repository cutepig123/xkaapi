non working, in progress, cholesky factorization


-- todo, bugs

. cublas considers matrices to be col ordered. The
current code considers row major ordering.
-> use transpose operations

. do not use magma, since we want to use on device
allocated matrices and asynchronous execution.
-> implement our own routines

. parts of potrf and getrf must be done on cpu
-> use postpone mode + a gpu task that forks on CPU
and GPU

. set_cublas_stream is not correct when used with
multiple GPUs
-> xkaapi should export:
kaapi_cublas_initialize();
kaapi_cublas_finalize();
kaapi_cublas_get_self_handle();
