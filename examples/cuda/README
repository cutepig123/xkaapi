This repository contains several examples about linear algebra:
- matrix product (matprod_iter_kaapi++)
- matrix product with recursive CPU tasks (matprod_rec_kaapi++)
- LU factorization without pivoting (matlu_nopiv_kaapi++)
- Cholesky factorization (matcholesky_kaapi++)
- Cholesky factorization with recursive POTRF panel (matcholesky_rec_bloc_kaapi++)
- Transform in CUDA (transform_static)

All these examples are based on C BLAS and C LAPACK (ATLAS interface), 
LAPACKE and LAPACK (for auxiliar functions). Some examples may use PLASMA functions.

** Environment variables **

It is mandatory to define the following environment variables:

CBLAS_CPPFLAGS
Directory of include file cblas.h and clapack.h, for
instance, if ATLAS was installed into $HOME/install/atlas:
$ export CBLAS_CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/install/atlas/include"

CBLAS_LDFLAGS
Include cblas and clapack libraries.
For instance, if ATLAS is installed in $HOME/install/atlas:
$ export CBLAS_LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/install/atlas/lib  -lf77blas -lcblas -llapack -latlas"

LAPACK_CPPFLAGS
Include LAPACK libraries if necessary.

LAPACK_LDFLAGS
Include LAPACK library. For instance:
$ export LAPACK_LDFLAGS="$HOME/install/lapack/libtmglib.a $HOME/install/lapack/liblapack.a"

LAPACKE_CPPFLAGS
Include LAPACKE lapacke.h header file. For instance:
$ export LAPACKE_CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/install/lapacke/include"

LAPACKE_LDFLAGS
Include LAPACKE library. For instance:
$ export LAPACKE_LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/install/lapacke/lib -llapacke"

** Optional **

PLASMA_CPPFLAGS
Include PLASMA header files. For instance:
$ export PLASMA_CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/install/plasma_2.4.6/include"

PLASMA_LDFLAGS
Include PLASMA library. For instance:
$ export PLASMA_LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/install/plasma_2.4.6/lib -lplasma -lcoreblas -lquark"

If ATLAS in into system path for finding includes or libs, then these
environment variables are useless.

** System **

All programs were tested using Debian GNU/Linux (squeeze) and Mac OS X Lion, and libraries:
- ATLAS 3.10.0 and ATLAS 3.9.69
- LAPACK (with LAPACKE) 3.4.2
- CUDA 4.1 and CUDA 5.0
- PLASMA 2.4.6 and PLASMA 2.4.2.
