== About XKAAPI ==

XKAAPI is a C implementation of Kernel for Adaptative, Asynchronous Parallel
and Interactive programming. The library allows to execute multithreaded 
computation with data flow synchronization between threads. 
The library is able to schedule fine/medium size grain program on distributed
machine. The data flow graph is dynamic (unfold at runtime).

On top of the C library, several interfaces co-exist: 
  - C++ data flow graph interface that allows to express in a simple way
  dependencies between tasks. It is called Kaapi++.
  - a C++ interface that match STL algorithms.
  - a low level C++ interface for adaptive algorithms, called AAPI.
  
An old C++ interface called Athapscan was yet supported.

Target architectures are **clusters of SMP machines** and MPSOC.

== Main features are ==
 - It is based on work-stealing algorithms ;
 - It can run on various processors ;
 - It can run on various architectures (clusters or grids) ;
 - It contains non-blocking and scalable algorithms ;
