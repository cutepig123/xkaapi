Developers Instructions

I. Autotools:
==============

  This project uses the autotools (autoconf, automake, autotest, etc.)
See INSTALL for instruction about how to compile and install X-Kaapi.

II. Autotest:
=============
  For testing this project, the autotest framework is used. Some information
can be found here:
http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Using-Autotest.html

  As a user of the test suite, you can run (from the build tests/ subdirectory)
the testsuite script in the tests/ *sources* subdirectory. The easiest way to
archive this is to type "make check".
  The testsuite script has lots of useful options. For example:
* "-l" option will list all tests with their keywords
* "-k k1,k2 -k k3" will only run tests with keywords (k1 and k2) or k3
* "-v" will run tests in verbose mode

  If one test fails, its number is shown and you will find information and
logs into the testsuite.dir/[number]/ directory. In particular, you will find
here a 'run' script that can rerun the failed test in verbose mode.

  When using "make check" to call the testsuite script, options can be
passed using the TESTSUITEFLAGS variable:
make check TESTSUITEFLAGS="-k fibo"  # run all tests with the 'fibo' keyword
make check TESTSUITEFLAGS="-l"       # list all available tests
make check TESTSUITEFLAGS="26"       # run the test numbered 26
