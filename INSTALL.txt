Installation from GIT
=====================

GIT users needs to run cmake before any other things ("cmake sourcedir") . This
will build required Makefiles. Then, standard instructions apply.
CMake version must be at least 2.6 and you don't need CMake if you compile
form a distribution.

Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cmake $SOURCE_DIR -DKAAPI_TARGET_MT=1' replacing $SOURCE_DIR by the right
     source directory.

  2. `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the library (default location : /usr/local).

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Runing Examples
===============

When the library is compiled, some examples are too. Here is how you can run
theses examples :

  1. `cd examples' to go into the example directory.

  2. `./example' where example is the binary name of one of the compiled examples.
