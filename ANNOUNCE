We announce the  release, as libre/free software, of  revision rc1 of 
the XKaapi  package for parallel programming. KAAPI means Kernel for Adaptative, 
Asynchronous Parallel and Interactive programming. It is a C/C++ library that 
allows to execute multithreaded computation with data flow synchronization 
between threads. The library is able to schedule fine/medium size grain program 
on distributed machine. The data flow graph is dynamic (unfold at runtime). 
This release targets multiprocessors machines.


Important features
==================

- XKaapi is build on top of a C runtime that uses work stealing scheduling
strategies.

- kaapi.h define a C api for creating tasks with dependencies as well as to
program adaptive algorithm using a original interface.

- kaapi++ is the C++ high level interface.

- kastl is a set of parallel algorithm that mimic the standard algorithms
found into the STL.



What is SCOTCH
==============

XKaapi  is a project carried out within  the MOAIS  team of INRIA Grenoble
(http://moais.imag.fr) and at  the Laboratoire  d'Informatique de Grenoble (LIG). 
Its goal is  to apply fundamental scheduling theory with fine grain implementation 
for multiprocessors.


How to get XKaapi
=================

XKaapi can be freely  downloaded, under  the terms of the  CeCILL-C license.
To ease the development, diffusion, and circulation of information regarding
the XKaapi project, most of its resources  are now hosted on the InriaGforge
platform provided by INRIA. Please refer to the XKaapi web page at :
