* SOME NOT ON USING GASNET with KAAPI

*************** Using gasnet on Grid500

I/ CONFIGURATION OF GASNET
- Gasnet needs to be compile with -fPIC options. This option
is passed as compiler option using such configure of gasnet:
> CC="gcc -fPIC" CXX="g++ -fPIC" ../GASNet-1.16.0/configure  --prefix=/home/tgautier/gasnet --with-mpi-cflags=-fPIC --disable-mpi --disable-seq --disable-parsync --disable-mpi-compat --disable-aligned-segments 
The --disable-aligned-segments option is required due to warning on linux.
It seems that segment between process is not aligned: TO BE VERIFY

II/ CONFIGURATION OF KAAPI
Once compiled and installed, Kaapi should be configured with options to indicate 
that network should be activated and the device gasnet should be specified 
the conduit to used. KAAPI uses the PAR mode of GASNET (multiple threads  may 
concurrently invoke gasnet primitives to send messages).

The typicall command line to configure KAAPI is:
> ../xkaapi/configure --prefix=/home/tgautier/KAAPI/install/xkaapi --enable-network --with-gasnet=/home/tgautier/gasnet/include/ibv-conduit/ibv-par.mak

the --with-gasnet should defined the conduit to used for Kaapi. Currently we cannot used several GASNET conduit
inside one KAAPI process. 


III/ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REQUIRED FOR KAAPI
KAAPI is based on dynamic loading of network device:
- GASNet network is name 'gasnet' and should be defined with environment variable
  KAAPI_NETWORK=gasnet
> export KAAPI_NETWORK=gasnet

Moreover, this variable is required to be defined on every node:
YOU SHOULD PUT IT INTO YOUR ~/.bashrc file. 
May be is can be redefined with a specific spawner for Kaapi.

Note that by default KAAPI created a number of threads equals to the number of cores,
so it may be desirable to set this number to 1 in the same maner as for KAAPI_NETWORK.

IV/ RUNNING EXAMPLE FOR KAAPI

Launching examples:
> GASNET_SSH_SERVERS=adonis-12,adonis-2 ~/gasnet/bin/gasnetrun_ibv  -spawner=ssh -n 2 ./ping_xx 

Typicall output is (debug mode)
  KAAPI_CPUCOUNT=1 GASNET_SSH_SERVERS=adonis-12,adonis-2 ~/gasnet/bin/gasnetrun_ibv  -spawner=ssh  -n 2  -E KAAPI_CPUCOUNT ./ping_xx 
    gasnetrun: unable to locate a GASNet program in '/home/tgautier/KAAPI/xkaapi/build-release/examples/./ping_xx'
  Device created: '0xd626b0'
  Device created: '0x128b6b0'
  My local_gid is:1
  My local_gid is:0
  1::1::[82.603000]: : local_gid:1, receive msg= 'Ceci est un message de 0'

The warning displayed by gasnetrun seems to due to the fact that 1/ ping_xx is a script
and gasnet cannot find gasnet symbol....


V/ TODO LIST
1- avoid definition of KAAPI_NETWORK in the .bashrc: it seems that gasnet used combination
of fork/exec/ssh to spawn several processes. If the environment variable is not defined on
the local process that launch command gasnetrun_ibv, then it does not work.
2- definition of a generic karun
