* SOME NOT ON USING TAKNET with KAAPI

*************** Using taknet

Taknet is the Kaapi network build on top of TakTuk Communication library, see man taktukcomm.
TakTuk could be download at http://taktuk.gforge.inria.fr.

The Kaapi network name is 'taken'. To launch program with taknet, the environment variable
KAAPI_NETWORK should be set to 'taknet' (even on remote process spawn by taktuk).
The taknet Kaapi network is not a high performance network but more a control network that
allow easily to pass firewall.

To launch program with taktuk, see man taktuk.
For instance:
> taktuk -m machine1 -m machine b e [ $PWD/ping_xx ]
