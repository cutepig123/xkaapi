\chapter{SMPss with \kaapi}
\label{chap:api_smpss}

This chapter presents how to use the SMPss programming model (http://www.bsc.es) with the \kaapi runtime. Within \kaapi, SMPss has been extended in the following direction:
\begin{description}
\item [recursivity:] with version 2.3 of SMPss, it is impossible to exploit natural parallelism from SMPss compilation chain. With \kaapi, the original SMPss compiler has been extended to allow recursive programs executed on parallel architecture with \kaapi. 
\item [affinity:] \kaapi extended the attribut of task in order to manage better affinity between tasks and data. This is especially important when programs run on NUMA architecture.
