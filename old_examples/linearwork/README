This example implements arbitrary degree
polynom evaluation in a given point using
the Horner scheme. A prefix algorithm is
used for parallelization.

XKAAPI low level adpative interface is used
to distribute the work amongst thieves.
Adaptive mode is set to concurrent, and
a kaapi_workqueue_t is used to handle concurrent
access between the sequential and the parallel
code.
Preemption is used to preempt a thief. A reduction
routine is called to reduce the processed work
and retrieve the thief continuation.

horner_kaapi.c uses the very lowlevel routines.

horner_kaapi++.cpp uses kaLinearWork.hh which
implements the future c++ apadtive interface to
handle linear work adaptive processing.
