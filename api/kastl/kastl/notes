-- bugs
. accumulate doesnot return the correct value
 . with >= 3 thread, but works with for_each
 . thus reduction bugged ?
  . missed thieves ?
  . at least, everything is processed (checked by marking items)
  . seems there is a problem in preemption, result not reloaded?
  --> actually thieves are missed, not reduced
  --> race between the splitter and the reducer
   -> redux doesnot see some in the splitter

-- todos
. brancher et recompiler le runtime
. ajouter les modifs necessaires a previous_branch/kastl_sequences.h

. faire les tests + les benchs

. window extractor
 . should slide as space becomes avail, not at the end of the loop
 . sizes must be of the right type (ie. sign errors...)

. faire un preempter, meme que reducer
 . PreemptionTag = nopreempt_tag

-- impl
