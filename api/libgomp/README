libKOMP is an implementation of the libgomp ABI on top of the XKaapi runtime system.

Once created, libgomp.{a,so} can replace the original libgomp library provided by gcc.

Here is a list of OpenMP constructs that may behave differently from the OpenMP 3.1 standard:
  * num_threads: 
    libKOMP's num_threads can't be set outside the [0, #cores] range. 
    A value outside this range for num_threads will be ignored by the runtime system.
