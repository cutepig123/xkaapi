    Allow to maintain meta information about version of data.
    A version is M producers and N readers (current M=1 because we do not support cw).
    When a new reader is added into a version, the readers information is updated:
      - the number of reader,
      - the thread index which is a reader
      - the reader task
      - the addr of the data into the thread of the reader.

    When a new writer task is added, then the previous version is not yet valid and :
      - a task to delete data is pushed into each partition that has a copy of the data 
      - the thread_readers information is set to 0.
      - these delete tasks are pointed by the task_readers field
      - a new data (renaming) is created on the thread that own the writer in order
      to avoid writing the data while an other task on an other partition is accessing it.
    The address of data referenced by the field addr_data on each partition, represents
    the address of invalidated data. If a new reader is added, then the delete_task body
    may be replaced by nop in order to reuse the data.
